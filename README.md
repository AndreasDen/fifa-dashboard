# TRVMP | fifa-dashboard

TRVMP is a single-page application prototype to track, analyze, and visualize FIFA gaming statistics. The idea came up while I and a couple of friends played frequently FIFA in our free time. It was always a real competition for us, so we decided to display some data. The frontend is built on Vue CLI and the backend is based on Python. 
 

## Usage

You can go to visit a live demo [here](https://AndreasDen.github.io/fifa-dashboard).
Feel free to play around and even add a new game to the data.

Since this is a WIP there may be some Bugs. 

## Roadmap
This prototype is WIP. There are a lot of ideas for the future: 
- build a UI for the users' profile. There could be functions like:
  - have access to settings (clear data, add member, create new group etc.)
  - personal statistics (some badges you earned (won tournament, the best player in... etc.)
  - build a tournament modus. The basic idea is to show statistics/table for a specific period of time. For example, you want to play one evening with some friends a championship modus (cf. soccer world championship).
- build a full functional Login to get access to the users' profile
- make some styling improvements and add a logo
- improve submit UI. Show user if data was successfully added or not.
- etc.
